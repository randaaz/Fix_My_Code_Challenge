# Fix My Code Challenge

## Debugging by Guillaume

## Background Context

Fix my code is a unique project where the goal is to dive into an existing codebase and fix issues. The language might be known or unknown, and the project is 100% optional. Completing any part will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your overall score won't be affected if you choose not to participate, but your average might decrease if your current average is greater than your score on this project. Have fun!
