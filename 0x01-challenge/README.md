# 0x01 Fix My Code Challenge

This project involves fixing existing code in various programming languages. The primary goal is to address issues without recoding everything.

## Background Context

Fix My Code is a unique project where the task is to dive into an existing codebase and resolve issues, whether familiar with the language or not. The repository [0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/username/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) serves as the initial files for all solutions. The project is optional but can contribute over 100% to your average grade. Remember, your score won't be affected if you choose not to participate, but your average might go down if your current average is greater than your score on this project.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Files should end with a new line
- A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder

## Tasks

### 0. Server status

**Advanced Task**

I have initiated a Flask project and set up a route for the API status. However, it's not working, and I need your help to fix it. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/username/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/main/0x01-challenge/status_server).

### 1. My square

**Advanced Task**

I have a love for geometry, and I've created a square. However, it seems not to be perfect. Can you take a look and suggest any necessary changes? The code can be found [here](https://github.com/username/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/main/0x01-challenge/square.py).

### 2. Step 2: User model

**Advanced Task**

I've started an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project, but nothing seems to work. Can you help me out? The code can be found [here](https://github.com/username/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/main/0x01-challenge/user.py).

### 3. Blog access

**Advanced Task**

I've completed and deployed my Rails blog, but users are reporting issues accessing blog posts. Additionally, I want to add a boolean 'online' for each Post object with a default value of true. This boolean will allow me to hide/show some blog posts from the listing. I'll also need a way to change this boolean in the Post#edit route. The code base is available [here](https://github.com/username/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/main/0x01-challenge/blog).

### 4. Never leave the office

After returning from a holiday, I discovered that my marketing co-worker broke the website. Let's fix it! There's also a pagination issue that needs attention. The code is located [here](https://github.com/username/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/main/0x01-challenge/react-blog).
